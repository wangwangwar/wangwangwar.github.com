### [Why we cancelled it][ref 1]

Brandon Keepers @GitHub shares his failure project experience and what
he learned:

1. Lesson 1: Curate a collective vision for the product.

2. Lesson 2: When you figure out what your vision is, define what it
   means to be successful, and just as importantly, define what failure
looks like. Set goals for achieving success, and check in on those goals
at regular intervals.

3. Lesson 3: Create meaningful constrains that make it easier to avoid
   failure and be successful.

4. Lesson 4: If you care about people, the product will take care of
   itself. Pour all your energy into making sure your teammates are
enjoying what they are doing. Happier people create better products.

5. Lesson 5: "Failure" is when you learn how to do something better the
   next time. I like failure.
