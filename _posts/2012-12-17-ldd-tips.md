+ 关于机制和策略(mechanism and policy)

	长久以来，我都把这个概念与接口和实现(interface and implementation)混淆在
	一起，傻傻分不清楚。谁谁谁(乔治~康师傅？)说过，如果能把一个概念向你隔壁的
	花朵或者大妈解释清楚，那么你就是真的理解了。好吧，我试试吧：

	拿锤子举个例吧，你捡到一个锤子，这就是你的”命运之锤“，你的”机制“，拿来干嘛
	呢？你可以用锤子砸核桃，砸冰箱(老罗？)，或者表演杂技(档部碎大石？)。这就是
	策略。换个角度，锤子提供锤东西的能力可以说是个接口，而具体锤子是用铁做的，
	铜做的，还是用钛合金做的，就是实现。

+ 关于抢占式(preemptible)和可重入(reentrant)
	
	> Finally, in 2.6, kernel code has been made preemptible; this change
	causes even uniprocessor systems to have many of the same concurrency
	issues as multiprocessor systems.
	>
	> As a result, Linux kernel code, including driver code, must be reentrant
	-- it must be capable of running in more than one context at the same
	time. Data structures must be carefully designed to keep multiple threads
	of execution separate, and the code must take care to access shared data
	in ways that prevent corruption of the data.
